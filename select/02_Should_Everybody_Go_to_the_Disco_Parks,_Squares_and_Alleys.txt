Everything in panic
Losing all control
I don't care of people
They are getting old

Some things makes me happy
Some thing like a show
I don't care of body,
money and my soul

Should everybody go to the disco
for having fun and some thing new
Should everybody go to the disco
for dancing, fight, sex and some crew
Should everybody go to the disco
Should everybody going to the disco show

Everything in panic
Losing all control
I don't care of people,
Money and my soul

Don't you think of future
I am from the past
everywhere computers
they are working fast

Should everybody go to the disco
for having fun and some thing new
Should everybody go to the disco
for dancing, fight, sex and some crew

Should everybody go to the disco
for having fun and some thing new
Should everybody go to the disco
for dancing, fight, sex and some crew
