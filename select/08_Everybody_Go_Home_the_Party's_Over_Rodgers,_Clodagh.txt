x2 Everybody go home... The Party Is Over

The party lights ... stop flashing and shineing
Brothers and belles, stop pressing and trying

x1 Everybody go home... The Party Is Over
Everybody go... on in the dawn night,
turn stop the lights of the music and the danceing
and the wine from flowing

x1 Everybody go home... The Party Is Over
Everybody go... on before i cry On your shoulders

To give and to get, whats so satisfiying
Forgive and forget, and mustnt stop trying

x1 Everybody go home... The Party Is Over
Everybody go and maybe its dawn and its geting colder
and colder and colder and c o l d e r

whoah Whoahohh
x4 Everybody go home... The Party Is Over
